Watch Andrew NG's lectures on Machine Learning.

Roadmap to learn ML:
1. Introduction to Machine Learning
2. Learning Problems and the Risk Minimization Framework. 
Loss Functions.
Naive Bayes Classifier.
3. Maximum Likelihood, Maximum a Posteriori, Naive Bayes Classifier. 
4. Decision Trees; Entropy, Conditional Entropy, Information Gain
5. Linear Regression 
6. ML in practice (Andrew Ng's advice) :  Metzen's blog that explores Andrew Ng's advice on ML. Highly recommended.

7. ML in practice (Cross-validation): Andrew Ng's notes on cross-validation, regularization and feature selection
8. Logistic Regression  
9. SVM: Andrew Ng's Notes on SVMs and Kernels
10. Multi-class SVM and kernel methods
11. Neural Networks; Perceptron and Multilayer Perceptron:  Tensorflow Playground - This is a wonderful tool to visualize neural networks.

12.  Backpropagation
13. Neural Networks - II 
 Cross-entropy, SoftMax, Maxout, Convolutional Layers
[Refer Michael Nielsen's notes for 11, 12 and 13]
14.  Reinforcement Learning
15. KMeans
