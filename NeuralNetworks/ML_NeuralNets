Exploring​ ​ data​ ​ sets: 
In​ ​ this​ ​ assignment,​ ​ you​ ​ need​ ​ to​ ​ use​ ​ two​ ​ datasets: 
● MNIST:​ http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/ 
● An​ ​ MNIST​ ​ subset:​ dataset_partA.h5  
Please​ ​ explore​ ​ both​ ​ these​ ​ datasets​ ​ on​ ​ your​ ​ own,​ ​ i.e,​ ​ number/kind​ ​ of​ ​ features,​ ​ number​ ​ of​ ​ of​ ​ data 
points,​ ​ number​ ​ of​ ​ classes.​ ​ Please​ ​ ensure​ ​ you​ ​ look​ ​ into​ ​ this​ ​ information​ ​ since​ ​ you​ ​ will​ ​ need​ ​ to 
handle​ ​ data​ ​ accordingly​ ​ in​ ​ the​ ​ section​ ​ below. 

Neural​ ​ Networks: 

1.Objective​ ​ #1​ ​ [80​ ​ marks]:​ ​ ​ Implement​ ​ the​ ​ forward​ ​ and​ ​ backpropagation​ ​ algorithms​ ​ to​ ​ train 
an​ ​ artificial​ ​ neural​ ​ network​ ​ from​ ​ scratch.​ ​ You​ ​ are​ ​ not​ ​ permitted​ ​ to​ ​ use​ ​ any​ ​ external 
libraries​ ​ in​ ​ this​ ​ part. 
a. Implement​ ​ a ​ ​ 2 ​ ​ layer​ ​ neural​ ​ network​ ​ with​ ​ 100​ ​ hidden​ ​ units​ ​ in​ ​ the​ ​ first​ ​ layer​ ​ and​ ​ 50 
in​ ​ the​ ​ next.​ ​ Implement​ ​ sigmoid​ ​ activation​ ​ function​ ​ in​ ​ each​ ​ layer.​ ​ Train/test​ ​ your 
model​ ​ on​ ​ the​ ​ MNIST​ ​ subset.​ ​ Report​ ​ accuracy​ ​ as​ ​ the​ ​ evaluation​ ​ metric​ ​ in​ ​ this​ ​ part. 
Save​ ​ the​ ​ weights​ ​ of​ ​ your​ ​ best​ ​ model​ ​ in​ ​ a ​ file.​ Please​ ​ ensure​ ​ that​ ​ while​ ​ your 
model​ ​ is​ ​ a ​ ​ 2 ​ ​ layer​ ​ network,​ ​ your​ ​ code​ ​ is​ ​ generalisable​ ​ and​ ​ can​ ​ be​ ​ used​ ​ out​ ​ of 
the​ ​ box​ ​ for​ ​ an​ ​ n-layer​ ​ network​ ​ (i.e,​ ​ do​ ​ not​ ​ hard​ ​ code​ ​ equations​ ​ for​ ​ the​ ​ 2 ​ ​ layers). 
b. Implement​ ​ a ​ ​ 2 ​ ​ hidden​ ​ layer​ ​ network​ ​ with​ ​ 100​ ​ hidden​ ​ units​ ​ in​ ​ the​ ​ first​ ​ layer​ ​ and​ ​ 50 
in​ ​ the​ ​ next.​ ​ Implement​ ​ softmax​ ​ at​ ​ the​ ​ output​ ​ layer​ ​ and​ ​ sigmoid​ ​ in​ ​ every​ ​ other 
layer.  
 Train/te st your mode l on the e ntire MNIST datase t. Re port accuracy as the
evaluation metric in this part. Save the we ights of your be st mode l in a file .
c. Implement ReLU and Maxout, and re pe at part A and B using the se activations at
every layer (except output).


2. Objective #2 [20 marks]: Use the Multi-Layer Perceptron model in sklearn to create an
artificial neural network.
a. Implement a 2 layer neural network with 100 hidden units in the first layer and 50
in the next. Train/test your model on the MNIST subset, using sigmoid activation
in each layer. Report the accuracy, as compared to what you received in 1A.
Explain reasons for an observed difference in accuracies, if any.
b. Implement a 2 layer neural network with 100 hidden units in the first layer and 50
in the next. Train/test your model on the entire MNIST dataset, using softmax at
the output layer and sigmoid activation in every other layer. Report the accuracy,
as compared to what you received in 1B. Explain the difference in accuracies, if
any.


3. Bonus [15 marks]: Use the Multi-Layer Perceptron model in sklearn to create an artificial
neural ne twork.
a. Experiment with network structure and find one that outpe rforms the one s you
tried above . Ple ase e xpe rime nt with at le ast 3 diffe re nt ne twork structure s and
provide your results. Try to provide some insight on the mode l structure s you trie d
and why the be st pe rforming structure pe rforms be tte r than the othe rs
Note :
-
The assignme nt is very time consuming, so please do start on time . The training time for
the mode ls will be considerable , so starting a day be fore the de adline will not suffice .
-
The emphasis of this assignment is on implementing the neural network yourself
(Objective #1). The idea behind Objective #2 is just to evaluate how your self-written
mode l performs; Objective #1 carries majority of the marks.
-
Your code for Objective #1 should be executable . We will run it at the time of the
evaluation, so please ensure both training and testing (including loading weights from the
file ) are in working condition.
